# README Templates

This directory contains README.md templates for repositories that are currently missing documentation.

2. Copy the contents of `EventSleuth-README.md`
3. Create a new file named `README.md` in the repository root
4. Paste the template content
5. Customize any project-specific details (screenshots, exact feature lists, etc.)
6. Commit the README to the repository

### For PSTInsight Repository

- **Project Overview**: Clear description of what the tool does
- **Features List**: Comprehensive list of capabilities
- **Installation Instructions**: Both binary downloads and building from source
- **Usage Guide**: How to use the tool effectively
- **Technical Details**: Architecture, dependencies, and technology stack
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Customization Notes

When using these templates, you may want to:

1. **Add Screenshots**: Include actual application screenshots
2. **Verify Features**: Ensure all listed features match the actual implementation
3. **Update Dependencies**: Check that dependency versions are accurate
4. **Add Build Status**: Include CI/CD badges if applicable
5. **Customize Examples**: Add real-world usage examples specific to the tool

## Repository Status

| Repository | Template Available | README Needed |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| EventSleuth | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| PSTInsight | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Why These Templates Exist

These templates were created as part of ensuring all public repositories linked from swatto.co.uk have proper documentation. Since the templates reside in the swatto.co.uk repository, they need to be manually copied to their respective project repositories.

## Maintenance

If features or details change in the actual projects:

1. Update the respective template here
2. Update the README in the project repository
3. Keep both in sync for consistency
